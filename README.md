This repository showcases a collection of maps I’ve created while participating in the #30DayMapChallenge, a month-long cartography challenge that encourages creativity, experimentation, and sharing of geospatial work.

Each map corresponds to a daily theme and is produced using a variety of tools and workflows in ArcGIS Pro, RStudio, and Python.
